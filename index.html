    <p>
      Welcome to my portfolio! I am Mario Reid, a full-stack web developer in
      Atlanta, GA who has completed a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development
      at Georgia Tech. For the past 13 years, I have been working as Senior Project/Compliance Manager. A change in work due to the pandemic provided me with an opportunity to pursue a long-term dream.</p>
    <p>I have always been interested in the technology of computers and whats able to be composed.</p>
    <p>I have a A.S. in Accounting and Microft Excel and Word Certificates. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my wife (Dianna) and one son (Rory), cooking, and volunteering at the Atlanta Humane Society.</p>
